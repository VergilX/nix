NIX STORE ARCHITECTURE:

        Nix Store ---> Store directory --- (if it can be accessed by filesystem; accessed via store path) ---> Store object --- Filesystem object(data)
                                                                                                                            |_ Store paths (to other packages)

                                                                                                                            
STORE PATH STRUCTURE:

  /nix/store/b6gvzjyb2pg0kjfwrjmg1vfhh54ad73z-firefox-33.1
  |--------| |------------------------------| |----------|
store directory            digest                 name

STORE DERIVATION:
    - A .drv file produced as an output of instantiation
